# A Yen For The Future

## Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

Based on my time series analysis, I wouldn't buy the yen now because the settle price is predicted to increase and the returns don't seem to increase at a fast rate.


## Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

The risk of the yen is expected to increase based off the GARCH Model in my time series analysis. The volalility seems to be increasing when I plotted the risk for the next year.


## Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?


Since the P value for the GARCH model is less than 0.05 I am confident in the volalilty forecast, but when it comes to the ARMA and ARIMA models the p value is greater than 0.05 so I would not feel as confident in using those models for trading. 


## Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?

The Linear Regression model performs better on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample-data because the out-of-sample root mean squared error is less than the in-sample root mean squaured error.
